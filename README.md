# News-Website
A Project Based On HTML , CSS &amp; JAVASCRIPT with The help of News-Ap


"Hello everyone, welcome to my project showcase. Today, I'm excited to present 'Headline Hub,' a news website that I've designed and developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."


"As you can see, Headline Hub is a fully functional news website that allows users to access the latest news and stay informed. It features a clean and user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices."


"What makes this project even more powerful is its integration with the NewsAPI. With this API, I can fetch real-time news from various sources and display them on the website. This ensures that the information is always up-to-date and relevant."


"As we switch between different screen sizes, you'll notice how the website's layout adjusts automatically to provide an optimal viewing experience. This responsiveness is achieved through media queries and CSS, ensuring that users can access news on the go, no matter what device they're using."


"In summary, Headline Hub is a testament to my front-end web development skills. It showcases my ability to create an interactive, responsive, and data-driven web application. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I'm excited to continue improving and expanding this project in the future. Thank you for watching!"
